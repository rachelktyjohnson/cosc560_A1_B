# COSC560 A1 Part B

This is a working HTML prototype for the trimester-long project, a food delivery service called DropBearEats.

This prototype is:
- Written in HTML5
- Passes HTML and CSS validation tests
- Includes the PureCSS framework (v2.0.3)
- Tested in Firefox on Turing

### User Flow
- The customer flow starts in `index.html`.  
- The admin flow starts in `admin-order.html`.
- But a user can navigate between the two in the navigation (only for this assessment)

### Assessment Restrictions
- Only one CSS framework (Pure v2.0.3) was used, specifically the grid and table
- SCSS was used as to write an overwriting stylesheet
- PureCSS does not come with Javascript functions
- Some custom vanilla Javascript was written to show a change in payment option fields


### This prototype demonstrates
- How a customer can order food
- How a customer can view previous orders and their status
- Pop-up notifications of an order, shown in `status.html`
- How an admin can edit a delivery order (change its status)
- How an admin can delete a delivery order
- The admin dashboard
